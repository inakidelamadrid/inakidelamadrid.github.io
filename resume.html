<h2>When did you start working as a web developer?</h2>
<p>Back in 2009, I got an internship in a web development company located in my city of origin (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colima">Colima, Colima, Mexico</a>) called CrowdInteractive (now MagmaLabs). Working as a trainee, I was mostly coding the repetitive stuff in the Rails based apps and coding simple stuff in JS (mainly with jQuery).</p>
<h2>What did you like the most, what did you learn in Crowd Interactive?</h2>
<p>I really enjoyed learning about the web development stack and processes. Also, I had the chance to work on-site for one of our clients <a href="https://modcloth.com">Modcloth</a> where I had the chance of traveling/working in SF ðŸŒ‰. </p>
<p>In San Francisco I worked in big, interdisciplinary teams and had my first experience with contnous delivery.</p>
<h2>So you moved and worked for several other companies right?</h2>
<p>Yes. I worked for two other startups before joining what I consider the biggest company I've worked for as a Ruby On Rails engineer, <a href="https://www.onelogin.com">Onelogin</a>. </p>
<h2>Can you tell me which were the other companies?</h2>
<p>Sure. In 2011, I met a team of nice US/Hungary developers that were developing a top iOS book selling app. The company was doing really well but the owner decided to sell. In this company I was in charge of building a web based version of the app. That web app was built with Ruby On Rails in a Heroku environment so it was mostly Ruby/JS development tasks.</p>
<p>In October of the same year, I got a nice chance to go back to San Francisco as a Web Dev for a company called WellnessFX. In the case of Wellness, I was coding Ruby and JS but, I must accept, I was not a strong developer at this point and decided to leave to learn more and get stronger at my skills.</p>
<p>Then I knew about Onelogin because of a friend and I joined.</p>
<h2>What were you doing in Onelogin?</h2>
<p>By April 2012, I started working at Onelogin. I started doing a lot of ruby backend programming in what is known as their <strong>"Provisioning Engine"</strong>. This engine was core to <strong>creating, removing, disabling</strong> and many other operations upon users in several third party apps like <em>Dropbox, Box, Yammer, Linkedin, Google</em>, etc.</p>
<p>Also, I was working on a separate project where the main objective was to link the Provisioning Engine with our clients LDAP directories. The project was really interesting due to its heavy use of multiplexed TCP connections.</p>
<p>In between my work in these areas, I was continuosly helping in the classic web development of request/HTML for the admin areas of the app, coding features for several releases.</p>
<h2>So, Onelogin was your last RoR job?</h2>
<p>Yes, by 2014 I had already started coding personal projects using Python but , when I left Onelogin in May 2015, I took a gig with a company that was using Django/Python as the base stack.</p>
<h2>How were your beginnings in Python?</h2>
<p>When I started with Python, it was tough to learn to do stuff without the magic that used to happen under Ruby On Rails. Many of the things needed to be really explicit, such as telling the framework to render an specific MIME or knowing how to serialize stuff to render in the correct format. But it paid back, and I consider that this is a milestone in my career because now I am more conscious of the HTTP protocol and what happens in the Request/Response cycle.</p>
<p>Also, learning Django also required from me to learn Python idioms that were really cryptic to me, such as decorators and iterators/generators but that now are part of my programming weaponry.</p>
<h2>And now, you are into Python and Security?</h2>
<p>Yes. I started my current job in February 2017. I was the first hire in the company and had to build our prototype . I used Django, Gunicorn and nginx to put the app up and I coordinate the deploys using the tool Fabric. </p>
<p>In between , I have had to code two other apps/services using other Python frameworks (Flask/Falcon) and to use Javascript a lot (right now we're using an old framework called Backbone).</p>
